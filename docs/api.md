- **lat**/**lon** *(required)*: center to reverse geocode (**lng** is also
  accepted instead of **lon**)
- every filter that has been declared in the [config](config.md) is available as
  parameters

Same response format as the `/search/` enpoint.


### /search/csv/

Batch geocode a csv file.

#### Parameters

- **data**: csv file to be processed
- **columns**: define the columns of the csv to be concatenated to create the
  search string (one column by `columns` parameter; default: all file columns are used)

  you will pass `postcode=code postal` and every row will be filtered according to the value of 'code postal'
  column
- `lat` and `lon` parameters, like filters, can be used to define columns names that contain latitude and longitude
  values, for adding a preference center in the geocoding of each row

#### Examples

    http -f POST http://localhost:7878/search/csv/ columns='voie' columns='ville' data@path/to/file.csv
